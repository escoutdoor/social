# Social network api
The main goal of building this app was learning new technologies for me, such as:
* Redis: caching and efficient data retrieval to improve performance.
* Docker-compose, air: easier to organize various services such as API server, PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO into a single development environment. Air for hot reloading.
* S3(MinIO): file storage for managing user-uploaded content
